Simstock documentation
======================

SimStock provides a workflow for taking geographical
and contextual data, processing it into a form compatable with EnergyPlus, and running thermal simulations. This workflow
broadly involves three steps: geometrical pre-processing,
followed by the creation of thermal zone object data for
EnergyPlus, and finally the running of the simulation itself. SimStock thereby provides an intermediate
layer between various data types and EnergyPlus, allowing
UBEMs to be run straightforwardly from QGIS etc.
